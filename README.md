Milestones is a Clojure library that needs your project tasks description in order to generate the best possible schedule for you, based on the scheduling priorities set.

The following constraints can be set on the tasks:
- Resources: Reseources required to perform the task
- The task duration 
- Predecessors: assign precedence order to tasks.

Based on the above constraints, Milestones generates the
Schedule provided there are no errors and all constraints are 
as required.

Tasks are basically a map containing IDs as keys and task information
as values. Task information is itself a  map of
associating fields to values- Here is an example :

```Clojure
{ 1 { :task-name "A description about this task" 
      :resource-id 2 
      :duration 5 :priority 1}
    
  2 {:task-name "A description about this task" 
      :resource-id 1 
      :duration 4 
      :priority 1 
      :predecessors [1]}}
```

Milestones also detects any circular dependencies, i.e., tasks
that depend on themselves or tasks that end up depending on
themselves. This is not allowed and it should be ensured that the 
tasks definition is a non cyclical graph.

Tasks (that are not milestones) without resource-ids won't be scheduled. Those will be reported as erroneous.

Special tasks with  :is-milestone "whatever" are milestones, they are assigned a random user
and a duration 1, so they can enter the computation like ordinary tasks. 
They must have predecessors, otherwise they will be reported as erroneous.

The output of Milestones is a schedule, that is, if success of computation; the very same
tasks map, with a :begin field, telling us when to begin each task. (Time is depicted as integers).
	
```Clojure
{ 1 { :task-name "A description about this task" 
      :resource-id 2
      :duration 5 
      :priority 1 
      :begin 0}
      
  2 {:task-name "A description about this task" 
     :resource-id 1
     :duration 4 
     :priority 1 
     :predecessors [1] :begin 5}}
```
## Installation

You can grab  it from clojars. Using Leiningen, you put the dependency in the **:dependencies** section in your project.clj:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/automagic-tools-milestones/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/automagic-tools-milestones)


## Usage

You fire the library using the **schedule** function , 
you pass to it a map containing  tasks and a vector containing the 
properties you want the scheduler to prioritize the tasks according to.
Priorities at left are considered first, less is scheduled first. Say
you want to schedule tasks with lower _:priority_ and then lower _:duration_ first:

```Clojure
    (schedule tasks [:priority :duration])
```

It gives you back tasks with **:begin** fields, or an error 
  
```Clojure
    {:errors nil
    
    :result {1 {**:begin** }}}
```

Or:
 
```Clojure
    {:errors {:reordering-errors reordering-errors
             :tasks-w-predecessors-errors tasks-predecessors-errors
             :tasks-cycles tasks-cycles
             :milestones-w-no-predecessors milestones-w-no-predecessors}
             
     :result nil}
```

### Sample Case

for example, if you have tasks def'd to:

```Clojure
    { 
    1 {:task-name "Bring bread"
         :resource-id "mehdi"
         :duration 5
         :priority 1
         :predecessors []}
         
    2 {:task-name "Bring butter"
       :resource-id "rafik"
       :duration 5
       :priority 1
       :predecessors []}
    
    3 {:task-name "Put butter on bread"
       :resource-id "salma"
       :duration 3
       :priority 1
       :predecessors [1 2]}
    
    4 {:task-name "Eat toast"
       :resource-id "rafik"
        :duration 4
        :priority 1
        :predecessors [3]}
    
    5 {:task-name "Eat toast"
        :resource-id "salma"
        :duration 4
        :priority 1
        :predecessors [3]}
    
    ;; now some milestones
    6 {:task-name "Toasts ready"
        :is-milestone true
        :predecessors [3]}}
```
you would want to run

```Clojure
    (schedule tasks [:duration])
```

and you'd have :

```Clojure
     {:error nil,
      :result {
      ;;tasks with :begin field, i.e at what time shall they be fired.
      1 
      {:achieved 5,
       :begin 1,
       :task-name "Bring bread",
       :resource-id "mehdi",
       :duration 5,
       :priority 1,
       :predecessors []},
      2
      {:achieved 5,
       :begin 1,
       :task-name "Bring butter",
       :resource-id "rafik",
       :duration 5,
       :priority 1,
       :predecessors []},
      3
      {:resource-id "salma",
       :achieved 3,
       :duration 3,
       :predecessors [1 2],
       :begin 6,
       :task-name "Put butter on bread",
       :priority 1},
      4
      {:resource-id "rafik",
       :achieved 4,
       :duration 4,
       :predecessors [3],
       :begin 9,
       :task-name "Eat toast",
       :priority 1},
      5
      {:resource-id "salma",
       :achieved 4,
       :duration 4,
       :predecessors [3],
       :begin 9,
       :task-name "Eat toast",
       :priority 1},
      6
      {:resource-id :milestone-user21667,
       :achieved 1,
       :duration 1,
       :predecessors [3],
       :begin 9,
       :task-name "Toasts ready",
       :is-milestone true}}}
```

Which you can pass to another program to render as a GANTT diagram (ours is coming soon.)
You should have _:achieved_ equal to _:duration_, or Milestones was not able to schedule all of the task - This
should not happen by the way.

### Errors 

 Error Map Key                 |  What it means
-------------------------------|-----------------------------
:reordering-errors             | { 1 [:priority],...} You gave priority to tasks according to fields (:priority) which some tasks (1) lack)
:tasks-w-predecessors-errors   | :{6 [13],...} these tasks have these non-existent predecessors.
:tasks-w-no-resources          | [1,... These tasks are no milestones and are not assigned to any resource
:tasks-cycles                  | [[1 2] [3 5]... Couple of tasks that are in a cycle : 1 depends on 2, and 2 on 1
:milestones-w-no-predecessors  | [1 2...  These milestones don't have predecessors


## History

The concept of auto-magic project scheduling is inspired from **the great**
[Taskjuggler.](http://www.taskjuggler.org). 

A first prototype of Milestones was built as an entry to the Clojure
Cup 2014. You can find the code and some technical explanation of the
algorithms in use (core.async, etc...) 
[here.](https://github.com/turbopape/milestones-clojurecup2014)

Although the protorype showcases the main idea, this repository is the official one, i.e, contains latest versions and is more thoroughly tested.
